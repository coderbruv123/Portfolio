                    Hi! I'm [Your Name], currently pursuing [My Education level] in [My College] in [My Course], a passionate developer with experience in building responsive and
                    user-friendly applications using React, JavaScript, and modern web technologies like DotNet acting as backend.
                    I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. When I'm not
                    coding, you can find me exploring new tech, reading, or enjoying the outdoors.
